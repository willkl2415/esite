            Cigar Manor was founded in the year of the pandemic 2021 by
            entrepreneur <strong>Sarisap B.K.</strong>, a former boxer with a
            deep passion for cigars. During his fighting career, cigars became
            a way to unwind and reflect after long, grueling bouts in the ring.
            Inspired by the wisdom and guidance of his late father
            <strong> M.S. Ullah</strong>, he created Cigar Manor to share this
            love and joy for cigars with the world.
