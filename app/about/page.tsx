              Cigar Manor was founded in the year of the pandemic 2021 by
              entrepreneur <strong>Sarisap B.K.</strong>, a former boxer with a
              deep passion for cigars. During his fighting career, cigars
              became a way to unwind and reflect after long, grueling bouts in
              the ring. Inspired by the wisdom and guidance of his late father{" "}
              <strong>M.S. Ullah</strong>, he created Cigar Manor to share this
              love and joy for cigars with the world.
